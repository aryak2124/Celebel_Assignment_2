# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

For installing the node modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Brief Testing Guidance`
Adding Tasks: Enter text into the input field and click "Add Task". The task should appear in the list.\

Removing Tasks: Click "Remove" next to a task to delete it from the list.\

Marking Tasks as Completed/Incomplete: Click the button to mark a task as complete/incomplete. Completed tasks should have a line-through.\

Filtering Tasks: Use the filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) to view tasks based on their completion status.\

Persistence: Refresh the page and ensure tasks are persisted correctly using localStorage.\

This should provide a solid foundation for your React To-Do List application with validation, dynamic task display, optional sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration.\
